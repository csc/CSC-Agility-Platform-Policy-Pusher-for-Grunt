## The "agility_push" and "agility_pull" tasks

### Overview
In your project's Gruntfile, add a section named `agility_push` to the data object passed into `grunt.initConfig()`.

```js
var agility_config = {
    options: {
        'agility_ip': 'localhost',
        'port': 8443,
        'username': 'admin',
        'password': 'password',
        'src_dest': 'src/',
        'delimiter': '___',
        'tree_folders': true, //If true, puts policies into a tree folder structure to mimic the tree in agility,
        'type_folders': false //If true, seperates policies into folders based on type (event, lifecycle-validation, etc)
    },
    files: {
        'changed': []
    }
}
grunt.initConfig({
    agility_push: {
        default_options: agility_config,
    },
    agility_pull: {
        default_options: agility_config,
    }
});
```

### Options

#### options.agility_ip
Type: `String`

The hostname of the Agility Platform you are developing against.

#### options.port

#### options.delimiter
Type: `String`
Default value: `'___'`

When creating local files for Event Policies, the delimiter will seperate the event policy name and the script name for the js script file name. If `'___'` occurs in policy names, change this value.

#### options.tree_folders
Type: `Boolean`
Default value: `true`

True: Seperates policies into a folder structure mimicing the container/project/environment structure of the Agility Platform

#### options.type_folders
